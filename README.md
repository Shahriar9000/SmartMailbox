# SmartMailBox
Smart Mailbox which allows users to safely retrieve their packages. 

Description: Created a smart mailbox system using Raspberry Pi 4, a camera, and a weight sensor. The system utilizes Python, NodeJS, and Java to automate package tracking and notifications.

Key Achievements:

Python Barcode Scanner: Developed a Python program that reads barcode data from the camera and efficiently stores it in a MongoDB database. This automation streamlines package tracking and reduces manual data entry errors.

Weight Sensor Integration: Integrated a weight sensor into the system to verify the placement of the correct mail package. This enhances package security and accuracy.

NodeJS MongoDB Database: Set up a MongoDB database using NodeJS to store package information securely and efficiently.

Android App Development: Designed and developed an Android app using Android Studio. The app provides users with real-time notifications upon the successful delivery of a package, enhancing user convenience and package tracking capabilities.

Technologies Used: Python, NodeJS, Java, Raspberry Pi 4, Camera, Weight Sensor, MongoDB, Android Studio.

Impact: The Smart-Mailbox project demonstrates strong problem-solving skills and proficiency in multiple programming languages and technologies. It showcases an innovative solution for package tracking and enhances user experience through timely notifications.
